Hi, I'm learning more about Deep Learning thanks especially to Jeremy Howard's wonderful Deep Learning for Coders course, of which I've been a participating student in 2019 and now 2020. I'm trying to use FastPages to publish more frequently the things I learn both in his course and otherwise, even though I have another [blog](https://redditech.blog) or [two](http://redditech.com/old-blog/) lying about already that have infrequent updates to them. I currently reside in Brisbane, Australia, but was born in the sunny Caribbean twin island Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.

This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1].
