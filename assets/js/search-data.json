          "content": "Hi, I’m learning more about Deep Learning thanks especially to Jeremy Howard’s wonderful Deep Learning for Coders course, of which I’ve been a participating student in 2019 and now 2020. I’m trying to use FastPages to publish more frequently the things I learn both in his course and otherwise, even though I have another blog or two lying about already that have infrequent updates to them. I currently reside in Brisbane, Australia, but was born in the sunny Caribbean twin island Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. . This website is powered by fastpages 1. . a blogging platform that natively supports Jupyter notebooks in addition to other formats. &#8617; . |",
