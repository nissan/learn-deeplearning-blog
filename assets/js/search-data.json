Hi, my name is Nissan Dookeran and while my day job is as a professional Full Stack Developer/Software Architect, I’m passionate about learning more about Machine Learning, Data Science, AI and Deep Learning. My adventures in Deep Learning are thanks especially to Jeremy Howard’s wonderful [Practical Deep Learning for Coders] (https://course.fast.ai/) course, of which I’ve been a participating student in 2019 of v3 (videos and other resources of which are available for free) and now the v4 in 2020 which should be available later this year. I’m trying to use FastPages to publish more frequently the things I learn both in his course and otherwise, even though I have another blog or two lying about already that have infrequent updates to them. . Originally I grew up in the sunny Caribbean twin island Republic of Trinidad and Tobago but have traveled the world with extended stays in Barbados, London (U.K), Mexico, Toronto(Canada) and the Boston(USA) before making Brisbane, Australia my present home. You can find out more about my professional career on LinkedIn or connect with me on Twitter(https://www.twitter.com/nissandookeran) or the fastai forums to chat more about any of the Deep Learning posts or notebooks I might publish here. .
