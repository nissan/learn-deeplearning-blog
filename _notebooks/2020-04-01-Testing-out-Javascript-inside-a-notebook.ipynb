The gist basically says I can set a python variable and then have the JSX declared later use this variable in what it displays. Let's give this a go using their sample"

I wonder if it will work with a more complex bit of code though. I'll have to dig further and update this post in future with what I find here. There seem to be a few more approaches I can try, and even a few [Javascript kernels for Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) online to experiment with."
